In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

It can select the relvant features and create a good model. However, we will need to be careful to avoid overfitting.|\n",

Without good domain knowledge, it treats all features as equally important (especially with normalization).

In addition, each student is marked as either \"passed\" or \"did not pass.\" Once the students are all plotted on the scatter plot, the SVC will try to place a line separating those students that did pass and those that did not. On one side of the line is the \"pass\" side and the other is the \"did not pass\" side. This line can not be perfect, but the algorithm will get a line that minimizes errors and maximizes its ability to generalize on unseen data i.e. predict if a new student will pass or not.**\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",
    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.gridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    "- Create the F<sub>1</sub> scoring function using `make_scorer` and store it in `f1_scorer`.\n",
    " - Set the `pos_label` parameter to the correct value!\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using `f1_scorer` as the scoring method, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_obj`."
